# shuffle-numbers
Shuffles an array of numbers into a random order. The array is length n, and contains the values 1 to n, once each.

Time complexity: O(n). Creating the array is a O(n) operation, and the loop to shuffle the array runs n times.

Space complexity: O(n). An array of length n is created, and shuffled in place.
